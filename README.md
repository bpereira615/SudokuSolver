# Project 1 - Udactity AIND
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver


### Overview
In this project, we have been creating an AI agent takes advantage of constraint propagation and search techniques to solve a sudoku puzzle. We have been writing code to implement two extensions of a generic sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. 


### Code

* `solutions.py` - various functions used for solving sudoku puzzle
* `solution_test.py` - unit tests for validating the Naked Twins and Diagonal solution methods in `solutions.py`
* `PySudoku.py` - visualization of sudoku puzzle
* `visualize.py` - visualization of sudoku puzzle


##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. See download and installation instructions [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).
